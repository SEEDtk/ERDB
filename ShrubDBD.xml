    <Notes>[p]The SEED database manages bio-informatics data imported from
        exchange files. It contains information that can be used to derive
        subsystem spreadsheets and support annotation of genomes. The
        annotation is three-tiered: for each protein, we recognize a
        [i]privileged[/i] annotation, which is curated by a human expert,
        a [i]projected[/i] annotation which is computed by annotation software,
        and a [i]non-priviliged[/i] annotation which is proposed by the
        user
        community.[/p]

            <Notes>A subsystem is a collection of roles that work together in a
                cell. Identification of subsystems is an important tool for
                recognizing parallel genetic features in different organisms. The
                key is a short string constructed from the original name.

                        written on paper in chemical notation, the stoichiometry is
                        the number next to the chemical formula of the
                        compound.

                    within that ordering, the main compounds appear first.

            <Notes>This relationship connects a subsystem row to the
                genome which it populates. A subsystem's occurrence
                in a genome is only represented if it is considered
                relatively important for annotation analysis and projection.

            <Notes>This relationship connects a subsystem to its populated

                of a subsystem in a genome by particular features. Thus,
                this relationship connects a subsystem to its implementations
                of interest.
