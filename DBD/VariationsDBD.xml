    <Title>AMR Variations Database</Title>
    <Notes>[p]This database tracks DNA variation sets for roles that
        differentiate between drug-susceptible and drug-resistant
        pathogens. A [i]variation[/i] in this context is a DNA column
        that varies between features for a specified role. A [i]variation
        set[/i] is a group of related variations. A variation set can therefore
        be thought of as a matrix where each row is a particular feature and
        each column is a variation (corresponding to a DNA location in the role
        alignment). We want to determine which rows of the matrix indicate drug
        resistance and which indicate susceptibility so that this information can
        be used to estimate the resistance phenotype for new genomes.[/p]

            <Notes>A feature (sometimes also called a gene) is a part of a
                genome that is of special interest. Features may be spread across
                multiple DNA sequences (contigs) of a genome, but never across more
                than one genome. Each feature in the database has a unique FIG
                ID that functions as its ID in this table.

            <Notes>A role represents a single effect of a protein in a cell. The
                fundamental purpose of annotation is to assign roles to proteins.
                The collection of roles (often only one) associated with a feature
                is the feature's function. Each role is assigned a short string key.
