            <Notes>A genome represents a specific organism with DNA.  The genomes
                generally come from PATRIC, but some may reside in other databases.
                A partitioning identifies genomes that are close and groups them
                together.
            </Notes>
            <Asides>The objects in this table are the primary
                items of interest.  A representative genome is captured in memory
                by the [b]RepGenome[/b] object.  Each is recorded in the partitioning
                directory in the [i]complete.genomes[/i] file and the
                [i]6.1.1.20.fasta[/i] file.  For represented genomes, all we need is
                the ID.  These are tracked in the [i]rep_db.tbl[/i] file.

            <Notes>A source represents a database containing genomes.  The source for most genomes is
                PATRIC.
            </Notes>
            <Asides>Currently, the source is not stored.  Almost all genomes are from PATRIC, and the rest
                are in the Shrub. The few scripts that deal with this issue look in Shrub first and then
                PATRIC when resolving a genome ID.

            <Notes>A parititioning divides all the genomes from a particular set
                into groups of similar genomes.  Each such group, called a
                partition, contains one representative genome and zero or more
                represented genomes, all within a certain threshold similarity
                of the representaitive.</Notes>
            <Asides>The partititioning is represented by a disk directory
                that is read into memory as a [b]RepGenomeDb[/b] object.  Traditionally,
                these directories are stored in the [i]RepServers[/i] directory,
                and almost all of them cover the good genomes in PATRIC.

            <Notes>A partition is a group of similar genomes belonging to a partitioning.
                It consists of a single representative genome and zero or more represented
                genomes that are close to it.
            </Notes>
            <Asides>A partition is represented by a [b]RepGenome[/b] object in memory.
                In the partitioning's disk directory, the attributes of the representative
                genome are stored in the [i]complete.genomes[/i] and [i]6.1.1.20.fasta[/i]
                files.  The ID of this record is the representative genome ID.  Given
                a [b]RepGenomeDb[/b] object, if you know the representative genome ID, you
                can use the [i]rep_object[/i] method to get the partition's [b]RepGenome[/b]
                object.
